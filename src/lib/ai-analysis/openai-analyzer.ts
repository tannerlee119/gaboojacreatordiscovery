IMPORTANT: You must respond ONLY in valid JSON format. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.

For the "category" field, you MUST choose ONLY from these predefined categories:

- fashion (clothing, style, fashion trends) 
- beauty (makeup, skincare, beauty tips)
- fitness (workouts, health, wellness, personal training)
- sports (professional sports, sports teams, athletes, sports commentary, fantasy sports)
- food (cooking, restaurants, food reviews, recipes)
- travel (destinations, travel tips, adventure)
- tech (technology, gadgets, reviews, tutorials)
- gaming (video games, gaming content, esports)
- music (musicians, DJs, music production, concerts, events)
- comedy (humor, memes, entertainment)
- education (learning, tutorials, how-to content)
- business (entrepreneurship, professional content)
- art (visual arts, creative content, design)

1. Creator Score (1-10): Overall rating based on profile presentation
2. Category: Choose ONE category from the predefined list that best matches this creator's content
3. Brand Potential: Partnership potential assessment
4. Key Strengths: Observable strengths from the profile
5. Overall Assessment: Brief summary

Focus on what's visible in the screenshot including profile aesthetics, follower counts, bio content, overall presentation quality, and any visible post thumbnails/content that help identify their content themes. If you can see post previews, briefly note what type of content they appear to create (e.g., lifestyle photos, product shots, workout videos, etc.) to better assess their brand alignment potential. Verification is a minor factor.

Respond in JSON format with these exact keys:

Provide a comprehensive creator analysis based on the visible profile information:
1. Creator Score (1-10): Overall rating with reasoning based on profile quality
2. Category: Choose the single best matching category from the predefined list based on their content
3. Brand Potential: Partnership suitability based on follower count, content quality, and presentation
4. Key Strengths: What makes them stand out from the profile
5. Engagement Quality: Assessment based on follower count, content quality, and profile professionalism
6. Content Style: Visual/aesthetic approach observed in the profile and any visible content
7. Audience Demographics: Likely audience characteristics inferred from profile elements
8. Collaboration Potential: Assessment based on profile professionalism and metrics
9. Overall Assessment: Summary and recommendations

Analyze the profile presentation, follower counts, bio quality, profile aesthetics, and overall brand consistency. Also examine any visible post thumbnails or content previews to understand their content themes and subject matter (e.g., fitness content, food photography, travel experiences, product reviews, etc.). This content analysis should inform category selection and collaboration potential assessment. Consider verification status as only a minor factor.

Provide an in-depth, premium creator analysis based on comprehensive observation of the profile:
1. Creator Score (1-10): Detailed rating with comprehensive reasoning
2. Category: Select the most accurate single category from the predefined list based on content analysis
3. Brand Potential: Detailed partnership suitability with specific recommendations
4. Key Strengths: Comprehensive analysis of unique value propositions
5. Engagement Quality: Deep assessment based on follower metrics, content quality, and profile professionalism
6. Content Style: Detailed visual/aesthetic approach analysis including content themes
7. Audience Demographics: Comprehensive audience profiling based on profile elements
8. Collaboration Potential: Detailed collaboration assessment with specific opportunities
9. Overall Assessment: In-depth summary with actionable recommendations

Conduct a thorough analysis of all visible elements: follower counts, bio content, profile aesthetics, username professionalism, link presence, and overall brand presentation. Pay particular attention to any visible post content/thumbnails to identify specific content themes, subjects, and style patterns (e.g., workout tutorials, recipe videos, product unboxings, travel vlogs, fashion lookbooks, etc.). This content analysis should directly inform brand partnership recommendations and collaboration opportunities. Verification badges are only a minor consideration. Provide strategic insights and actionable recommendations for brand partnerships based on these comprehensive observable factors.
